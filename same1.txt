Export the key as an open SSH key
Here is a walkthrough on putty gen for the above steps

2. Associate the SSH key with the remote repository
This step varies, depending on how your remote is set up.

If it is a GitHub repository and you have administrative privileges, go to settings and click 'add SSH key'. Copy the contents of your ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub into the field labeled 'Key'.

If your repository is administered by somebody else, give the administrator your id_rsa.pub.

If your remote repository is administered by your, you can use this command for example:

scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub YOUR_USER@YOUR_IP:~/.ssh/authorized_keys/id_rsa.pub
